# Scripting APIs

Scripting APIs use LabVIEW VIs to configure Custom Devices in a VeriStand system definition file.

Depending on how much functionality was made available through Scripting for a specific Custom Device, users can change basic settings, or fully configure a Custom Device.

You can develop a Scripting API to create flexible and reusable system definition files. 

NI has developed Scripting APIs for some NI supported Custom Devices. One such example is the [Scripting API for the FPGA Addon](https://github.com/ni/niveristand-fpga-addon-custom-device/blob/main/Source/Quick%20Start%20Documentation/FPGA%20Addon%20Quick%20Start%20Guide.md#scripting-api) Custom Device.

The functions for this Scripting API are grouped into: **Custom Device**, **Bitfile Resources**, and **Utilities** palettes.
