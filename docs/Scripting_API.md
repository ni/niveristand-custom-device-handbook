# Scripting APIs

Scripting APIs use LabVIEW VIs to configure custom devices in a VeriStand system definition file.

Depending on how much functionality was made available through scripting, users can change basic settings or fully configure a custom device. You can develop a scripting API to create flexible and reusable system definition files.

Scripting API functions are grouped into the following LabVIEW palettes.
1. Custom Device
1. Bitfile Resources
1. Utilities
