# Scripting APIs

Scripting APIs use LabVIEW VIs to configure custom devices in a VeriStand system definition file.

Depending on how much functionality was made available through scripting, users can change basic settings or fully configure a custom device. You can develop a scripting API to create flexible and reusable system definition files.

## NI Supported Scripting APIs

NI has developed scripting APIs for some custom devices.

One example is the [FPGA Addon Scripting API](https://github.com/ni/niveristand-fpga-addon-custom-device/blob/main/Source/Quick%20Start%20Documentation/FPGA%20Addon%20Quick%20Start%20Guide.md#scripting-api). The following image displays how the API appears in LabVIEW.

The following custom devices also have a scripting API.

* [Instrument Addon Scripting API](https://github.com/ni/niveristand-fpga-addon-custom-device/blob/main/Source/Quick%20Start%20Documentation/FPGA%20Addon%20Quick%20Start%20Guide.md#scripting-api)
* [Routing and Faulting Scripting API](https://github.com/ni/niveristand-fpga-addon-custom-device/blob/main/Source/Quick%20Start%20Documentation/FPGA%20Addon%20Quick%20Start%20Guide.md#scripting-api)
